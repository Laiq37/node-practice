|-| Hashing is one way communication, mean plaintext can be converted to hashvalue but hash value cant convert back to plaintext
|-| Encryption is two way communication, conversion b/w plaintext to cypher text, and cypher text to plaintext

|-| there are multiple hashing algorithm
    MD5 is the weakest hashing algorithm which can be hacked within 2s
    bCrypt is the best hashing algorithm which is very difficult to be hacked and it take more than 3years to be hacked
