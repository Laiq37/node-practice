|-| In node all files are modules
|-| By default their scope is private, means not accessible from outside of module, to use one module objects in other module we have to export them
|-| wraperfunction of node is also known as IIFE function, this is basically a anonymous function which wraps the content of module and cuz of it module
    objects become private
|-| IIFE stands for immediately invoked function expression
|-| Var vs Let
    if we define a variable then it will be available inside and outside of scope, but let only available inside scope(locally)
|-| We can create our own web server with only node js(which handle requests asynchronously)
|-| when we are using nodejs then we dont need to use 3rd party webserve like Apache, IIS etc
|-| How to open our locally create webserver in browser
    in browser just type localhost:portNumber
|-| To show our response on browser we uses res.end() funtion we can also use res.write() which holds the response and res.send() to show response
    but res.end() does both thing on its own so we dont need to use it
